# Computer Graphics Algorithms in Unity

This project is a collection of computer graphics algorithms implemented in Unity for a university course. It serves as a practical demonstration of several fundamental concepts in computer graphics.

## Features

The application showcases the following algorithms and features:

### Line Drawing Algorithms
*   **Slope Intercept:** The basic method using the y = mx + b equation.
*   **Slope Intercept (Fixed Point):** An integer-only version of the slope-intercept algorithm.
*   **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA):** An incremental algorithm for line drawing.
*   **Bresenham's Line Algorithm:** An efficient integer-only line drawing algorithm.
*   **Bresenham's Circle Algorithm:** An algorithm for drawing circles.

### 2D Geometric Transformations
*   **Translation:** Move an object in 2D space.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate an object around a point.
*   **Scaling:** Resize an object.
*   **Shear:** Skew an object.
*   **Reflection:** Reflect an object across a line.

### Fractals
*   **Sierpinski Triangle:** A classic fractal based on a triangle.
*   **Koch Snowflake:** A fractal curve.
*   **Mandelbrot Set:** A famous fractal set generated from complex numbers.
*   **Julia Set:** Another fractal set closely related to the Mandelbrot set.
*   **Iterated Function Systems (IFS):** A method for generating fractals, like Barnsley's Fern.

### Other
*   **Pong:** A simple implementation of the classic game Pong, with movable paddles and a ball.
